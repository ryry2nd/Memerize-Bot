# Memorize-Bot
It is a bot for the Memorize website for school

Instructions for morons: (if you have a Mac these instructions won't work, just google how to run a jar file on a Mac and how to extract a zip file, also if you have linux, figure it out)
download the file and place it somewhere you will remember
install java from https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp
extract the zip file
double click on the config file and run it with notepad
after username write your email for memorize
after password write your password
save and quit
double click the bat file
its running now

(if you want to run it from somewhere else then create a shortcut)

For best performance:
plug the computer into an ethernet cable
if it is a laptop, plug it in
have good wifi
